Why is it useful to encapsulate JavaScript code in a module as described in chapter 10
of Eloquent JavaScript?
  by wrapping up your javascript code in a module you keep your code from messing with
  global variables when not needed, and you gain some namespace (because the variables
  are generated locally).


Describe what asynchronous programming is and how it differs from the style of
programming you used in C and Python.
  Asynchronous programming means that the program runs apart from the server. Javascript
  runs on the browser and it doesnt need constant feedback from the server to keep running.
  This makes it possible to change the webpage without reloading it.


Is JSON valid JavaScript? Describe the differences between JavaScript and JSON.
  JSON is not the same as javascript. Javascript is a script, an actual program which
  is able to "do" things with the webpage. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation
  and is just a way to write down objects as strings, derived from javascript, but every
  language is able to transcribe JSON to objects (if such a structure exists in the
  language).
